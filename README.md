# Calculator    



>> The code starts with the HTML code for a web page. Then, there is a meta tag that sets the character encoding to UTF-8 and specifies IE as the browser that will be compatible with this website. Next, there is an <meta> tag that defines viewport width and initial scale of 1.0 which means it will adjust to fit any screen size without having to change anything else on the page. Next comes CSS code for stylesheet which has been linked in from another file called "styles.css". The next line starts with title text followed by opening tags for a div element named container and two div elements named header and calculator respectively inside of it. Inside of those two divs are h1 tags which are used as titles for both headers, then finally some content between them: <h1>Calculator Make easy to Calculate</h1>
The code is a form that will display the result of the calculation. The <input> tag is where the user enters their input, and the <div> tags are used to separate each part of the form.


>> The code starts with a <div> tag that contains an input type="button" element. The value attribute of the button is set to "AC". On click, the value attribute will be changed to "C". The code then has two more buttons: one for "7", and one for "+". The next section of code starts with a <div> tag that contains three buttons. Each button has its own onclick event handler function. One sets the value to 6, another sets it to 5, and another sets it to 4. There is also a button called "-", which changes the value from AC (the default) to C (on click). The final section of code starts with four buttons: 00, 0, 1, and *


>> The code is an example of a JavaScript function that will add one to the value of the input field. The code begins with <input type="button" value="1" onclick="display.value += '1'"/>, which adds 1 to the input field's current value. The next line <input type="button" value="2" onclick="display.value += '2'"/>, adds 2 to the input field's current value and so on until it reaches "*". The last line in this snippet <input type="button" value="00" onclick="display.value += '00'"/>, subtracts 00 from the input field's current value and displays it in a string format as 00
